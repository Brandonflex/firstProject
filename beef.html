        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <p>Step 1</p>
        <p>
          Gather all ingredients.
        </p>

        <p>Step 2</p>
        <p>
          Cook and stir bacon in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until bacon is browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and transfer bacon into a large stew pot, reserving bacon fat in the skillet.
        </p>

        <p>Step 3</p>
        <p>
          Season beef chuck cubes generously with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste. Turn heat to high under the skillet and sear beef pieces in the hot fat on both sides until browned, about 5 minutes. Place beef in the stew pot with bacon, leaving fat in the skillet.
        </p>

        <p>Step 4</p>
        <p>
          Turn heat down to medium; cook and stir onions in the retained fat in the skillet until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes; season with a large pinch of salt.
        </p>

        <p>Step 5</p>
        <p>
          Cook garlic with onions until soft, about 1 minute. Pour beer into the skillet and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up and dissolving any browned bits of food into the liquid.
        </p>

        <p>Step 6</p>
        <p>
          Pour cooking liquid from the skillet into the stew pot. Stir in tomato paste, carrots, celery, thyme sprigs, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and enough chicken broth to cover.
        </p>

        <p>Step 7</p>
        <p>
          Bring stew to a gentle simmer, stirring to combine; reduce heat to low and cover pot.
        </p>

        <p>Step 8</p>
        <p>
          Simmer stew until beef is fork-tender, about 2 hours.
        </p>

        <p>Step 9</p>
        <p>
          Stir stew occasionally and skim fat or foam if desired.
        </p>

        <p>Step 10</p>
        <p>
          Remove cover and raise heat to medium-high. Bring stew to a low boil and cook until stew has slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard thyme sprigs and adjust salt and pepper to taste.
        </p>

        <p>Step 11</p>
        <p>
          Arrange mashed potatoes in a ring in a serving bowl; ladle stew into the center of the potatoes.
